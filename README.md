# README file describing R and bash scripts used for: “Genomic variation from an extinct species is retained in the extant radiation following speciation reversal, Nature Ecology and Evolution 2022”


All scripts to generate the results (starting with processing of raw sequence data, mapping, calculation of genotype likelihoods and the analyses done) can be found in the folder lsf_submit_scripts. Scripts were run according to the sequence described in the file on the ETHZ cluster Euler.

All scripts to visualize and finalize the data are in the folder R_scripts.
